"Awesome work Buggs!" you hear from the crowd gathered behind you.

As the unlocked files spit out their data, it's clear that Rand was involved in far more online criminal activity than you could have ever imagined.

It's been a tiring two days, but the support from your team feels amazing right now.

"Thank guys, I hope this finally brings Epoch... I mean Rand... to justice."

"I'm sure it will," says Agent Getter with a smile.

As you get ready to head back home for some much needed rest, your new boss Rob comes over to congratulate you.

"Agent Buggs, you single handedly took down the cyber-criminal of the decade and brought back one of our top Agents in the process. I can't thank you enough for all your hard work," says Rob.

"Thanks," you reply. "I still can't believe Epoch was right under our nose the whole time."

"I think we have a lot to catch up on when you're rested. I'll buy you a cup of coffee over at Pike's Place in the morning," Rob says as he pats you on the shoulder.

"Oh, and don't be late for the ceremony tomorrow!"

"What cermeony?" you reply.

"The medal ceremony! You're getting the prestigous Medal of Victory! The new Director is coming by personally to congratulate you," Rob smiles beaming with pride.

"Wow, what an honor," you say under your breath, stunned at the news.

You leave feeling exhausted, but satisfied with a job well done.
